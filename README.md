## Introduction to Halo
-----------------------------------

Halo lets us create Cloud resources easily by defining them in simple human understandable yaml format. The template need not be one huge template, we can split resources into seperate logical files and include them in the main template file. We can also paramterize the resouces so that the templates are resuable with diffrent values.
